//KMP Algorithm â€“ Linear Time Pattern Searching O(n+m)
//uses the fact that when ever we get a mismatch we already know some characters already match

//for example:
//text = "aaaa"
//pattern = "aaa"
//we will compare first three characters naively
// then for the second window we will only compare the forth character since we already
// know the first two match

//Notice: = lps = longest proper prefix which is also a suffix
// for example a proper prefix of "a" is only ""
// the lps of "aa" is "a"

//lps is used to determine how many characters can be skipped
